Auto - Pretty cool, knew about it before but hadn't tried to use it. Refactored a few things in tetris to try it out.
For range loop, used this with auto, interesting...
Standard init - {}, nice and simple
A double is 8 bytes.
constexpr - Constant expression, done at compile time.
Vector is not just a container type! 
Invariants are interesting, i've covered them a little in the computer paradigms course too.
