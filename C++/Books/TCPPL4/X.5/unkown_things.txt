Interesting things:
STL provides a lot of support for many things, too many to list here and i get the feeling that there are many more than listed in this chapter.

there is a future header, didn't know this!

containers know nothing about the algorithms which use them, they just supply the iterators which work upon them.

Lots of interesting new things in the end of this chapter, especially regarding containers, iterators and streams. I need to read this again some time.


2) Vector<T>, unordered_map<K, V>, List<T>, Map<K, V>, Set<T>
3) sort(), find(), count(), find_if(), copy()
4) <iostream>, <string>, <vector>, <future>, <memory>, <list>, <map>
